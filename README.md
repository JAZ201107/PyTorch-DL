This repository contains the code for deep learning methods in the different field:

- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Meta Learning
- Graph Neural Networks

And so on.
Each jupyter notebook is self-contained and has the code for the model, training, and evaluation.

The purpose is to get familiar with the different deep learning methods, algorithms and how to implement them in PyTorch.
